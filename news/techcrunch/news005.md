Last year was a monumental year for the AI industry in the U.S. and beyond.

There were 49 startups that raised funding rounds worth $100 million or more in 2024, per our count at TechCrunch. Three companies raised more than one “mega-round” last year, and seven companies raised rounds at $1 billion or larger.

How will 2025 compare? It’s still early in the year but the number of U.S. AI companies that have raised more than $100 million is almost in double digits, and there has already been one round larger than $1 billion.
