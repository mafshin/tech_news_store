Apple announced this week that the “more personalized” version of Siri that it promised last year has been delayed — and according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, that’s also postponed the launch of the company’s planned smart home hub.

In a statement, Apple said the upgraded Siri features, which are part of its broader Apple Intelligence suite, will “take us longer than we thought to deliver,” and it now expects to launch them in the “coming year.”

Gurman said that Apple’s smart home hub relies on the new Siri features, so it’s been postponed as well. He’d previously reported that the device could be released as soon as March 2025 (so, this month). It would reportedly include a six-inch touchscreen that’s mounted on the wall, could be used for video calls and managing smart home devices, and would be largely controlled by voice.

Despite the delay, the company has reportedly started an internal testing program allowing employees to take the device home for feedback.
